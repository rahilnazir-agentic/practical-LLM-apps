## About this repo

**Practical LLM Apps** is a collection of real-world Streamlit applications built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs).  
Each app focuses on a clear user pain point and a concrete outcome – not just a chat UI.

- Every app lives in its **own folder** and runs independently.
- All apps are **browser-based** via Streamlit, so you can demo them quickly with non-technical stakeholders.
- Each app ships with:
  - a dedicated `README.md` (what it does, key ideas, and setup), and  
  - a `requirements.txt` with all dependencies.

The goal: give builders a set of **copy-paste starting points** for serious LLM work – grounded in real problems from community feedback (Reddit, forums) and industry use-cases.

We organise the apps in two ways:

- by **LLM technique** (RAG, classic “LLM apps”, and agentic workflows), and  
- by **domain**: E-commerce, Healthcare, Education, Finance, and Legal.

We’ll prioritise **E-commerce** and **Healthcare** first, with at least one detailed, production-minded example app in each domain.
